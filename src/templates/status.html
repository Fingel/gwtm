  <h2>Observatory Statuses</h2>
  <p>The COVID-19 pandemic is forcing closure of many astronomical facilities around the world. Below is a list of the status of various observatories, contributed by the community. <br>
  	We encourage members of the astronomical community to add any information they may have to this list. 
<br>
  The list can be edited, or added to, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pNjeOzcMVSEAgQQy5i3C4ojjq2sI9Aee9adbQpVaWyc/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. <b>We ask that you only change the status of an Observatory if you know FOR A FACT that the listed status is incorrect</b>. 
<br><br>
The 'Status' should be interpreted as providing the most useful information to Astronomers regarding <i>whether the observatory is performing observations</i>, and should only reflect whether the site is 'Open' to people/visitors insofar as this may affect the capability to perform observations. Please feel free to use the 'Notes' column liberally.
<br><br>
Any concerns or questions about the information listed here can be directed to: a.tohuvavohu@mail.utoronto.ca
<br>
  Thank you to Jamison Burke for starting the spreadsheet.</p>
