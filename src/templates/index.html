  		<h2>Welcome to the Gravitational Wave Treasure Map</h2>
		  <p>The Treasure Map is designed to help coordinate electromagnetic followup of gravitational-wave (GW) events. It allows observers to easily report their planned and executed observations in search of counterparts to GW events, and to query the reports of other observers, in a programatic way. The goal is to enable coordination between observatories in order to minimize unnecessary overlap in these searches and find the counterpart as quickly and as efficiently as possible.</p>
