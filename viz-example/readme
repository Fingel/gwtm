This directory hosts an example visualization build from data for S190425z.
There is a geojson contour file that hosts the pre-calculated GW contours paths,if you want to recalculate, you can also do that in the notebook, but it takes ~20 second to run. I suggest adding the contour making code to the GCN listener and then storing the geojson files with the skymaps.

All of the pointing, instrumen, and footprint information is sourced directly from the GW treasuremap API.

The default output of the notebook is the file 'index.html' which shows the vizualiztion built. There is also a method to save only the div, and then insert that as desired within a larger webpage/html framework.
